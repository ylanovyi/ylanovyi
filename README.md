#### 1. 👤 Personal Details  
  **Thought:** To construct the foundation of the profile, I need to establish who Yaroslav Lanovyi is—starting with his identity and background context. By analyzing publicly available data on LinkedIn, X, and personal references, I confirm that Yaroslav is a 21-year-old male currently based in London. His contact email is **yaroslav@clarisign.ai**, and he's listed as a software engineer, AI developer, and technical founder. These descriptors point to both hands-on technical expertise and entrepreneurial initiative.


#### 2. 📈 Career 
  **Thought:** My goal is to chart a timeline of Yaroslav's professional growth. I begin by ordering the roles chronologically and evaluating their progression. Based on the infromation provided, there is a strcutured timeline I found:
  - Jun 2019–Jul 2022: Development Team Lead & CTO at IT Start, growing AI/robotics education to 21 branches.
  - Jun 2023–May 2024: Development Team Lead at Olympus, delivering endoscopy dashboards and digital organ-twin software.
